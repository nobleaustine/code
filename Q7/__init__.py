7. Solving Maze Problem using OpenAI Gym Library: The objective of this lab exercise is to
 understand and implement a reinforcement learning solution to solve a maze problem using the
 OpenAI Gymlibrary.

    A. Introduction to OpenAI Gym:
        a. Provide an overview of the OpenAI Gym library and its functionalities for reinforcement learning tasks.
        b. Explain the concept of environments, agents, actions, and observations in the context of Gym.

    B. Setting up the Maze Environment:
        a. Define a custom maze environment using Gym that represents a maze with walls, a start point, and a goal point.
        b. Implement functions to initialize the environment, reset it to the starting state, and render the maze for visualization.
    
    C. Defining Actions and Observations:
        a. Define the possible actions that an agent can take in the maze environment (e.g.,move up, down, left, right).
        b. Determine the observations available to the agent at each state (e.g., current position, proximity to walls or goal).

    D. Implementing Q-Learning Algorithm:
        a. Implement the Q-learning algorithm to train an agent to navigate through the maze environment.
        b. Define the Q-table to store Q-values for state-action pairs.
        c. Implement the exploration-exploitation trade-off strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy) to balance exploration and exploitation during training.
        
    E. Training the Agent:
        a. Train the agent using the Q-learning algorithm to learn an optimal policy for navigating the maze.
        b. Monitor the agent's learning progress by tracking rewards obtained during training episodes.
        c. Visualize the learned policy and the agent's trajectory through the maze.
